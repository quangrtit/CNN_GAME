# [PYTORCH] Convolutional Neural Networks for Playing Tetris

## Introduction

Here is my python source code for training a Tetris playing agent. It can be considered as a very basic example of the application of image processing and convolutional neural networks.

## How to use my code
With my code, you can:
- Get data in [text](< CrawlDataFromYoutube/process_data.ipynb>) and link colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qh5x03UQ5lOYLzSYAtWhDAwC6uHMfCl0#scrollTo=qzLB4Ew5Mq_Q and link youtube I get data https://www.youtube.com/@ClassicTetris
- Train your model and processing data in [text](traningModel/preProcessDataAndTraning.ipynb) and link kaggle if you want run it https://www.kaggle.com/code/khngqungb22dccn654/cnn-tetris
- Test your trained model by running `python test.py`

## Data Collection & Training Process

- The training data was collected from YouTube videos of world championship Tetris matches. Frames were extracted from the videos and processed into images for the CNN model.  
- The data collection process was quite complex. The approach is outlined in `process_data.ipynb`, and the preprocessing steps are detailed in `preProcessDataAndTraning.ipynb`.  
- After preprocessing, nearly **one million images** were available for training.  
- After training for approximately **1000 epochs**, the model achieved a decent level of performance, clearing **30 to 80 lines** per game.  
- Currently, I am optimizing the model with a goal of **200 complete lines**, but achieving this remains a challenge. ðŸ˜…
